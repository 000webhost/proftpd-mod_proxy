mod_proxy

  ProxyEngine
  ProxyLog
  ProxyMode forward|reverse

Why?
  Have mod_netsieve here, for sieving the inbound commands and outbound files
  (have netsieve rules for common cases like scanning for SSNs/credit card
  numbers in outbound data)

  Single SSL cert (on the proxy) for several different backend servers

What would a proxy module for proftpd look like?

  client <-------> mod_proxy <--------> FTP server

So we'd be proxying FTP connections to other FTP servers, including data
transfers.  Would we support both forward and reverse proxy configurations?

  * Set DefaultServer on in the <VirtualHost> section using mod_proxy (or
    don't set it all).  That way, on a proxy server, only connections to
    vhosts configured for proxying are handled; others are rejected.

Forward Proxy
  Need some kind of mechanism that clients can use to specify their end
  targets.

  Keep this restricted, as it can be used to "hide" the origin of attacks,
  using your proxy as the jumping off point.  Think of open email relays.

Reverse Proxy
  Terminates any SSL session (backend connection to use SSL or not?)
  What credentials to use for authenticating to backend server for a reverse
  proxy connection?  Modifying of directory listing results as necessary

  How to map clients to origin servers?  By user name, by client IP, or...?
  Re-use proxy USER/PASS with origin server, or override with shared/common
  origin server USER/PASS?  Round-robin, consistent hashing, load balance?
  *Do it based on USER: that's the one feature that mod_proxy can do (i.e.
   it's protocol-aware); the other implementations are TCP-specific, and
   can be done by nginx, haproxy, etc.

    { remote_user, remote_passwd, remote_host, remote_port } = lookup_remote_info(user)

  If map/lookup is done based on client IP, then it can be done at connect
  time, and thus mod_proxy can relay the connection to the remote host, and
  let all authentication be handled by the remote/target host.

  Scenarios:

    Simplest:
      mod_proxy configured to always use the SAME backend server.  In this
      case, proxying the control connection is trivial; the backend server does
      all of the protocol work.  The control connection from proxy to backend
      server is opened when client connects to proxy.  However, mod_proxy DOES
      need to watch for EPRT/EPSV/PASV/PORT commands, rewrite the responses
      from the backend server to use the proxy's IP address/port.

    Next simplest:
      Just as above, except that there is a list of backend servers, and
      some selection mechanism (roundrobin [weighted or not],
      consistent hashing based on client IP, etc).  Selection mechanism
      should be pluggable.

    Complex:
      backend server selection based on USER; this means mod_proxy needs to
      handle login, _then_ select backend and create control connection to
      selected backend.

      *NB: Actually, the selection of the backend user *can* happen based
       on just the USER command, no PASS; this assumes that the auth will
       either succeed using the given USER, or it won't (and the connection
       will be closed).  This distinction means that the proxy does not
       necessarily have to handle authentication itself.

    Balancing (or: selection of backend server)
      ProxyReverseConnect
        roundrobin [options]
        hashing (?) [options]
        userbased [options]

      ProxyReverseServers ftp://localhost:20741 ftp://localhost:20743 

      ProxyReverseServers file://path/to/servers.txt
                          sql://SQLNamedQuery/...
                          ldap://...?

Any caching of proxied results, files, directory transfers, etc?

Use of DNAT/SNAT, so the remote/target server sees real IP of connecting
client, rather than that of the proxy?  Or how else to inform the
backend/origin of the connecting client info?  Keep in mind this possibility:

  client -> proxy -> proxy -> proxy -> proxy -> server


FTP to SFTP proxying:

  http://superuser.com/questions/422348/ftp-to-sftp-scp-proxy

for securing outbound connections (in a forward proxy mode), as well as SFTP
to FTP proxying (e.g. for SFTP for external clients, FTP for internal/legacy
servers) for reverse proxying.

  * Use URIs for specifying protocol proxying; means needing a URI parser
    good enough to extract scheme, host, port, and perhaps authority.

Health checks
  TCP

Authentication:

  USER user@remote.site, proxy-user@remote-user@remote.site and other
  variations.  (No "CNCT" FTP command; should there be one, e.g. HTTP CONNECT?
  Probably not, given the easy abuse of such things.)

Data Transfers:

  Client requests active transfer; does proxy request active transfer, too?

  SSL/TLS data transfers on frontend, backend?
  MODE Z on frontend, backend?

Load balancing

Failover

Timeouts
  ProxyConnectTimeout

Reverse connectivity feature?  (Requires that the backend server know to
connect to proxy for "listening" connection, so custom work.)

HTTP CONNECT

  Client sends CONNECT to proxy, then proceeds to do an _FTP_ control channel
  through the established TCP connection.

  * Can this be used to proxy/hide the origin of an SSH connection as well?
    I think so...

client --> (sftp) --> proxy --> (ftp) --> origin
client --> (ftp) --> proxy --> (sftp) --> origin

  Contrast with Squid, Apache mod_proxy, others

  Net::FTP in Perl; use Firewall, FirewallType constructor args.  See
  Net::Config perldocs (quite interesting, actually).
