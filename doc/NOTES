What would a proxy module for proftpd look like?

  client <-------> mod_proxy <--------> FTP server

So we'd be proxying FTP connections to other FTP servers, including data
transfers.  Would we support both forward and reverse proxy configurations?

Forward Proxy
  Need some kind of mechanism that clients can use to specify their end
  targets.

Reverse Proxy
  Terminates any SSL session (backend connection to use SSL or not?)
  What credentials to use for authenticating to backend server for a reverse
  proxy connection?  Modifying of directory listing results as necessary

Any caching of proxied results, files, directory transfers, etc?

Data Transfers:

  Client requests active transfer; does proxy request active transfer, too?

  SSL/TLS data transfers on frontend, backend?
  MODE Z on frontend, backend?

Load balancing

HTTP CONNECT

  Client sends CONNECT to proxy, then proceeds to do an _FTP_ control channel
  through the established TCP connection.

  * Can this be used to proxy/hide the origin of an SSH connection as well?
    I think so...
