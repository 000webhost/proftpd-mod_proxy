Simple balancing:

  round robin
  least conns
  equal distribution (all servers have same number of conns)
  staticly configured affinities

Complex/adaptive balancing:

  Client IP address/class
  FTP USER (i.e. user affinity to specific server(s))
  SSL/TLS protocol version
  SSL/TLS ciphersuite
  Backend response time
  Backend connection count
